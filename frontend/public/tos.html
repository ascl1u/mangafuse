    <h1>MangaFuse Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 8, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>This is the Terms of Service for MangaFuse ("the Service"), provided personally by Andy Liu ("I", "me", "my"). These Terms govern the relationship between you ("you" or "User") and the Service. By creating an account or using MangaFuse, you agree to these Terms and accept to be bound by them. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. The Service & Your Account</h2>
    <p>MangaFuse is an AI-powered "co-pilot" tool designed to help accelerate the manga scanlation process. The Service is provided as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and is offered on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, which means it may have bugs or be unavailable at times.</p>
    <p>You agree that you are at least 13 years old. You are responsible for keeping your account password confidential and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

    <h2>3. License, Restrictions, and Your Core Responsibility</h2>
    <h3>3.1 License Grant to You</h3>
    <p>I grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to use the MangaFuse service for its intended purpose.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Restrictions of Use</h3>
    <p>You shall not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Service. You may not use the Service to create a product that is competitive with MangaFuse.</p>
    
    <h3>3.3 Your Content and Copyright (Important)</h3>
    <p>You are solely and entirely responsible for the images and content you upload ("User Content"). By uploading User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights and permissions to do so. Any legal issues that arise from your use of the Service, including but not limited to copyright infringement, are your responsibility alone.</p>
    
    <h3>3.4 License Grant to Us for Service Improvement</h3>
    <p>To help operate and improve the Service, you grant MangaFuse a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and analyze your User Content. This license is strictly for the limited purpose of improving the MangaFuse service and its underlying AI models.</p>

    <h2>4. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>MangaFuse offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans are billed on a recurring monthly basis. Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds for partial months. All payments are handled by a secure third-party payment processor; we do not store your credit card information. We reserve the right to change our prices with prior notice.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>I may, at any time and for any reason, suspend or terminate your access to the Service with or without prior notice. If you fail to comply with any of these Terms, your right to use the Service shall terminate automatically.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided without warranties of any kind. As an individual operator, I will not be held responsible for any damages (including loss of data, profits, or other intangible losses) that arise out of your use of, or inability to use, the Service. Your use of MangaFuse is at your own sole risk.</p>

    <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
    <p>In addition to the basic information required to maintain your account, we collect the content you upload for processing.</p>
    <p>This uploaded content will remain strictly for internal use and will not be sold or distributed to third parties. The content may be used to improve the MangaFuse service. Your personal data and content will not be sold or distributed.</p>
